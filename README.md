Hangman is a word guessing game that can be played by two or more players. Here’s how it works:<br>

Objective: One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.<br>
Gameplay:<br>
The word to be guessed is represented by a row of dashes (one dash for each letter).<br>
The guessing player(s) select letters from the alphabet.<br>
If the chosen letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).<br>
If the letter is not in the word, a part of a stickman (the “hangman”) is drawn.<br>
The game continues until either the word is completely revealed or the hangman is fully drawn.<br>
Rules:<br>
The number of incorrect guesses allowed varies (usually represented by the number of body parts on the hangman).<br>
Wrong guesses from vowels (such as ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’) typically do not count as mistakes and do not draw the man. It’s advisable to click on all the vowels first.<br>
The game can be made easier or harder by adjusting settings.<br>

Features added:<br>
-version 2 is better than version 1 as in version 1 we are guessing the words randomly from the given row of words.<br>
In version2 we are guessing the letter randomly from "A to Z".If we are guessing a right letter it is shown written there"You have guessed the letter"and if wrong letter is guessed it is written "Wrong guess!" if we are guessing word instead of letter then it is written "Invalid input!Please enter a single letter" and it also show how many turns we are left with .If we are guessing the right letter than it is being filled in the blanks .If our turn is over and we have not guessed the word right then it shows "OOPS!you are ran out of turn" <br>
-version 3 is more better than version 2 as the Hangman is welcomed in the beginning of the game.It is  more organised than version 2.If we lose the turn then it shows "game over" and it is shows the correct word that was to be guessed.
