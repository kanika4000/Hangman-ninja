   The Hangman game is a classic word -guessing game that challenges that can be played by two or more players.The game typically involves a player attempting 
    to guess a letter chosen by another player.The word to be guessed is represented by a row of dashes, each dash representing a letter. The game ends when the 
   guessing player(s) either guess the letter correctly or the complete hangman figure is drawn.If the hangman figure is completed before the word is guessed, the 
   guessing player(s) lose the game.It's a fun and engaging  game that challenges players' vocabulary, deduction, and spelling skills.<br><br>

   #<b><u>Objective:</b></u><br>
   One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. 
   <br>.
   #<b><u>Game Play:</b></u><br>
     1. The letter to guess is represented by a row of dashes, with each dash representing a letter or number of the word.<br>
     2. The guessing player suggests a letter.<br>
     3. If the suggested letter occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions.<br>
     4. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player adds one element to a hanged stick figure (or removes an element, depending on the 
        rules).<br>
     5.The game continues until the word is guessed or the stick figure is complete, signifying that all guesses have been used.<br><br>
     #<b><u>Rules:</b></u><br>
     Here are the rules for playing the classic game of Hangman:<br>
     # <u>Host Selection:</u><br>
         1. Choose one person to be the “host” who creates the puzzle.<br>
         2. The host selects a word and draws the initial hangman figure.<br>
         3. Other players will guess letters to identify the word chosen by the host.<br>
         4. You can take turns being the host or play multiple rounds with the same host.<br>
     # <u> Blank Spaces:</u><br>
         1. As the host, draw a blank line for each letter in the word.<br>
         2. For example, if your chosen word is “zipper,” draw six blanks: _ _ _ _ _ _.<br>
         3. Keep the secret word hidden from other players.<br>
     # <u> Guessing Letters:</u><br>
         1. Players take turns guessing letters.<br>
         2. Commonly guessed letters include vowels (“a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” “u”) and frequently used consonants (“s,” “t,” “n”).<br>
     # <u>Filling in Blanks:</u><br>
         1. When a player guesses a letter correctly, the host fills in the relevant blank.<br>
         2. For example, if the word is “zipper” and the players guess “e,” the host fills in the 5th blank: _ _ _ _ e _.<br>
      The game can be made easier or harder by adjusting settings.<br>
     #<u><b>Additional features to be required:</u></b><br>
       # <u> 1.Difficulty Levels:</u><br>
             Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with varying word lengths or limited guesses.<br>
             Adjust the number of incorrect guesses allowed based on the chosen difficulty level.<br>
        # <u>2.Categories and Themes:</u><br>
              Allow players to choose from different word categories (e.g., animals, countries, movies).<br>
              Customize the game theme based on the selected category.<br>
         # <u>3.Word Definitions:</u><br>
              Display the definition of the secret word after the game ends.<br>
              This feature can be educational and help players learn new words.<br>
         # <b> Version1:</b>In version1 there is no show any how many attemps are left or not.so the player does not sure about hiow many attempts are left.
               This is big problem faced by the player.<br>
         # <b>"Version 2"is better than "version 1"as in version 1 we are guessing the words randomly from the given row of words.<br></b>
           In" version2" we are guessing the letter randomly from "A to Z".If we are guessing a right letter it is shown written there"You have guessed the 
           letter and if wrong letter is guessed it is written "Wrong guess!" if we are guessing word instead of letter then it is written "Invalid input!Please 
           enter a single letter" and it also show how many turns we are left with .If we are guessing the right letter than it is being filled in the blanks .If 
           our turn is over and we have not guessed the word right then it shows "OOPS!you are ran out of turn" <br>
       # <b> Version 3:</b>It is more better than "version 2" as the Hangman is welcomed in the beginning of the game.It is  more organised than "version 2" If we 
              lose  the turn then it shows "game over" and it is shows the correct word that was to be guessed.<br>
