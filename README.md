  " The Hangman game is a classic word -guessing game that challenges that can be played by two or more players.The game typically involves a player attempting 
    to guess a letter chosen by another player.The word to be guessed is represented by a row of dashes, each dash representing a letter. The game ends when the 
    guessing player(s) either guess the letter correctly or the complete hangman figure is drawn.If the hangman figure is completed before the word is guessed, the 
     guessing player(s) lose the game.It's a fun and engaging  game that challenges players' vocabulary, deduction, and spelling skills."<br><br>

   <b>Objective:</b><br>
   One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. 
   <br><br>
   <b>Game Play:</b><br>
     1. The letter to guess is represented by a row of dashes, with each dash representing a letter or number of the word.<br>
     2. The guessing player suggests a letter.<br>
     3. If the suggested letter occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions.<br>
     4. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player adds one element to a hanged stick figure (or removes an element, depending on the 
        rules).<br>
     5.The game continues until the word is guessed or the stick figure is complete, signifying that all guesses have been used.<br><br>
     <b>Rules:</b><br>
     Here are the rules for playing the classic game of Hangman:<br>
      <b>Host Selection:<br></b>
         1. Choose one person to be the “host” who creates the puzzle.<br>
         2. The host selects a word and draws the initial hangman figure.<br>
         3. Other players will guess letters to identify the word chosen by the host.<br>
         4. You can take turns being the host or play multiple rounds with the same host.<br>
       <b>Blank Spaces:<br></b>
         1. As the host, draw a blank line for each letter in the word.<br>
         2. For example, if your chosen word is “zipper,” draw six blanks: _ _ _ _ _ _.<br>
         3. Keep the secret word hidden from other players.<br>
       <b> Guessing Letters:<br></b>
         1. Players take turns guessing letters.<br>
         2. Commonly guessed letters include vowels (“a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” “u”) and frequently used consonants (“s,” “t,” “n”).<br>
      <b>Filling in Blanks:<br></b>
         1. When a player guesses a letter correctly, the host fills in the relevant blank.<br>
         2. For example, if the word is “zipper” and the players guess “e,” the host fills in the 5th blank: _ _ _ _ e _.<br>
      The game can be made easier or harder by adjusting settings.<br><br>
