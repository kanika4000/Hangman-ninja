Hangman is a word guessing game that can be played by two or more players. Here’s how it works:<br>

Objective: One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.<br>
Gameplay:<br>
The word to be guessed is represented by a row of dashes (one dash for each letter).<br>
The guessing player(s) select letters from the alphabet.<br>
If the chosen letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).<br>
If the letter is not in the word, a part of a stickman (the “hangman”) is drawn.<br>
The game continues until either the word is completely revealed or the hangman is fully drawn.<br>
Rules:<br>
The number of incorrect guesses allowed varies (usually represented by the number of body parts on the hangman).<br>
Wrong guesses from vowels (such as ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’) typically do not count as mistakes and do not draw the man. It’s advisable to click on all the vowels first.<br>
The game can be made easier or harder by adjusting settings.<br>
